The goal of this project is to provide everything needed to manage and
manipulate gentoo ebuilds within haskell.

To start with, we'll work on creating a:

- [ ] parser for existing ebuilds
- [ ] data type to hold all relevant ebuild information
- [ ] writer to output an ebuild file given a valid `ebuild` data type
