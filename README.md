The goal of this project is to provide everything needed to manage and
manipulate gentoo ebuilds within haskell.

To start with, we'll work on creating a:

-[ ] parser for existing ebuilds
-[ ] data type to hold all relevant ebuild information
-[ ] writer to output an ebuild file given a valid `ebuild` data type
